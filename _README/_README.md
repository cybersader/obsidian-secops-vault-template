# Using This Example

- I've named folders with commas to show different ways to describe the space.  Don't feel like you have to use either of them for structuring the vault.

## DROPZONE

- Use ISO 8601 with YAML timestamp (leave moment JS empty)
- Implement a user database with YAML
- .

## 1) Folder/Vault Structure

- Projects, Workspaces
	- Actionable projects, current objectives, workspaces for temporary or maybe ongoing initiatives
- Areas, Objectives, Initiatives
- Resources, Topics
- Archive, Unstructured
- 

# Wiki Technical Guide

- Lists
	- Use Ctrl + "." as much as you can when starting lists or turning packs of newline delimited text into a bullet list
- Linking - Pages, File Shares, URLs
	- Use "Ctrl+K" as much as you can
	- Linking to other pages in wiki:
		- Always paste links to other pages in the wiki (right click page -> copy link)
		- Ctrl-K then search for the page
	- Always paste related network share paths where you can (right click -> copy path)
	- When highlighting text, Ctrl-k, then paste copied link for hyperlink
- History Tab
	- Use this tab in OneNote to find what you worked on over time or during the day for recollection
- Emoji keyboard on Windows
	- "WINDOWS BUTTON + . (period)"
- Shortcuts
	- The important ones:
		- Search (Omnisearch) - ALT + S
		- Toggle bullet list - CTRL + .
		- Add/Edit Task - CTRL + \`
		- Type "\%\% Waypoint \%\%" to create a linked table of contents of the notes below that folder
		- Create a folder, then "CTRL + CLICK" the name to create a folder note for that folder.  You can also right click the folder to do it.
	- Hit "CTRL + SHIFT + K" to explore keyboard shortcuts for this vault
- Action Items - Meetings, Areas
	- Use "Alt + Shift + D" to add dates
	- Use "ALT + H" to highlight
	- At the end of meetings, make action items and highlight them at the top of that day so it's easy to find them at the next recurring event/meeting
- Tasks
	- Use " Ctrl + \` "
- Folder INBOXes or DROPs
	- If a folder needs a DROPZONE, then just call it DROPZONE or DROP ___ and put things that need to be distilled.  You can even call it INBOX or leave the emoji (⬇️) in front of it.  

# Useful Productivity Tools Alongside Vault

- Screenshots
	- ShareX for screenshots and GIFs - download from MS store

# Ideas for improvements

- Tasks are the hardest thing to integrate with a wiki - let alone in a corporate setting
